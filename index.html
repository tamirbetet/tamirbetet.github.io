## 👋 Hi, my name is Tamir Aharoni

Hello, I’m Tamir, a creative lead, animation director, and writer.  
I work at the intersection of storytelling, design, and emerging technology.  
I build unusual worlds, engaging characters, and the systems to bring them to life.

My background spans web series, short films, and experimental R&D. I’ve led AI-driven pipelines for animation, collaborated with engineers to develop creative workflows, and written and performed work that continues to resonate with audiences.

Most recently, I was Creative Lead at **Alma Studios**, a stealth-mode startup, where I built a generative pipeline powering over 100 original YouTube channels.  
While the project focused on testing scalable content systems, my role centered on designing tools and workflows that ensured creative consistency, narrative identity, and emotional impact—not just mass production.

Earlier, I co-created and co-hosted **The Dictators**, a successful comedic web series for Kan Public Broadcasting Corporation.  
The show still draws a dedicated YouTube following today.

I thrive in creative R&D spaces where story meets code, and experiments lead to something surprising, engaging, and meaningful.

## 🧠 Case Study: Alma Studios

**How I Built the Creative Engine Behind 100 YouTube Channels**

At Alma Studios, I was tasked with testing a radical question:

> *Can AI-powered workflows produce emotionally resonant animation at scale, without compromising originality or quality?*

### Highlights:
- Designed a modular prompt architecture to generate songs, lyrics, visuals, and lore-aligned characters  
- Created a scalable style guide for thumbnails and brand cohesion  
- Built multi-stage prompt flows with R&D, balancing consistency with surprise and freshness  
- Established a viewer-feedback loop to generate ideas directly from the audience and turn them into new episodes

### Results:
- First channel reached 1,000 subscribers and monetization within a month  
- Scaled to 100 unique, functioning channels with distinct identities  
- Proved that automation and engaging storytelling can coexist when the systems are designed with intention

## 🌍 About Me

Outside the studio, I’m a two-time Israeli Poetry Slam champion and world finalist.  
I’ve performed internationally, blending humor, rhythm, and emotional precision on stages in France, Italy, Canada, and beyond.

I’m also a mountain climber and lifelong traveler.  
After my military service, I co-authored a trekking guide to the southern Jordanian desert with Boaz Langford, a geologist, cave explorer, and mentor.

These experiences shaped how I see creative work:  
**as exploration, as navigation, and sometimes as survival.**

## 🚀 Call to Action

I’m looking for my next adventure!

I want to join teams building the future of creative expression. Whether that's:

- **Narrative-Driven Products** – where story and function are inseparable  
- **AI Creative Collaboration** – designing tools where humans and AI create together  
- **Experimental Media** – pushing the boundaries of how stories can be told  
- **Creative Tool**
